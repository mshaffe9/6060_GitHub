# 6060_GitHub

CA-01

The purpose of this assignment is to understand the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process. I fulfilled the steps of the EDA process by understanding the data with visualizations, pre-processing the data by cleaning what I could, and post-processing the data with feature selection and collinearity using the house price train dataset (uploaded to this GitHub folder). Another purpose of this assignment is to determine the list price of homes for sellers, so my EDA is catered towards achieving that outcome. 

I have uploaded the house-price-train.csv and house-price-test.csv files that consist of the data used in this assingment. However, my code does not require the use of these files since the data is read using a link to a GitHub repository. I also uploaded a data_description.csv document which outlines what each column consists of within the dataset. After reading the data descriptions, it gave me a better understanding of how to start handling the data.

To view this assignment, download the 6070_CA_01.ipynb file and upload it to JupyterLab. Run all of the code and scroll from top to bottom to see my process of understanding the data, cleaning the data, and the beginnings of analyzing the data. I have embetted headings, comments, explanations, and observations within the code so that it is more easily understood to the viewer. I have also written a conclusion that shares my final thoughts and findings upon reflection of this assignment.
